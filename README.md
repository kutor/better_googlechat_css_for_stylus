# better_googlechat_css_for_stylus
A CSS that makes Google Chat actually usable. For the Stylus browser extension.

There are some people with whom I still use Google Chat to converse, and I was fed up with its ridiculously unusable appearance. So I made my own CSS and now I can go back into the old days when users could actually see more than 15-20 lines of chat text and apps didn't have ridiculous form-over-function interfaces.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. 
Some elements may still not look good, especially if I personally don't use them often enough. 
Also Google likes to change classes every now and then, causing the entire thing to fall apart again.
